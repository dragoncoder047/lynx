            * [Nodes Reference](./reference)
            * [Examples](../examples)

            ## File Format of a Flow

            A Lynx file is formed of one or more [S-expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-expression) that begin
            with a datum type, and are followed by any number of other items that the datum type is defined to handle.

            A Lynx flow is composed of nodes connected to each other. A node can be seen as a black box of sorts, that
            takes in data through zero or more inputs, processes it in some way, and then sends it back out through zero
            or more outputs. Notice I said *zero or more*: there can be nodes that have no inputs or no outputs (or even
            no inputs *and* no outputs!) --- for example, the [`button`](./reference#node-button) node has no inputs to
            the node itself because the whole purpose of the node is to watch for input from the user (i.e. clicking and
            hovering the HTML `&lt;button>` that the node creates) and provide those events (via the outputs of the
            node) to the rest of the flow.

            Nodes' inputs and outputs are **typed**. This means that an input expecting a number can't be
            connected to an output providing a string. Lynx will yell at you if you try to do this --- even if the
            connection would have still worked if allowed.

            ### Creating Nodes

            Nodes can be created in two ways: named and inline.

            A **named node definition** looks just like a normal top-level Scheme variable definition. For example, if
            you wanted the node `myButton` to be a [`button`](./reference#node-button) displaying the text "Click me",
            you would write it like this:

            ```scheme
            (define myButton (button "Click me"))
            ```

            The second way is by defining it inline in the chain, which is explained below.

            ### Connecting Nodes

            Nodes are connected by listing them in chains. Each chain is contained in one `(chain)` datum and is
            composed of two or more nodes. The data flows from left to right through the chain, being transformed along
            the way through the nodes' ports (inputs and outputs).

            For example, to connect three nodes `foo`, `bar`, and `baz`, you can write:

            ```scheme
            (chain (foo) (bar) (baz))
            ```

            provided the types of the connected ports match.

            This form only works if the nodes only have one output or input that can be connected -- if there are
            multiple, Lynx won't know which one you're referring to and, rather than guess and run the risk of doing
            something you didn't intend, Lynx will just yell at you. To specify which input or output you can add
            symbols starting with `:` in-between the nodes with the names of the inputs or outputs:

            ```scheme
            (chain (foo) :output-name-from-foo :input-name-to-bar (bar))
            ```

            If one node has only one input or output that would make sense there (i.e. the only one with the right type)
            you can omit that symbol, and Lynx will automatically figure out which one you are referring to. (But it's
            good practice to always specify if there's multiple ports on that side of the node.)

            ### Referencing other nodes

            The simplest form of reference is to a named node. Simply write the name you gave it and then the rest of
            the flow:

            ```scheme
            (define myNode (...))
            (chain (foo) myNode (bar) ...)
            ```

            If the node you want to refer back to is a part of the same chain, you can also backreference it by node
            type. Do this by writing `@` plus the type of the node, and Lynx will insert another reference to the most
            recent instance of that node type here. This does not create another node of that type -- it references the
            *same node*. This is useful for nodes that contain internal state and that have many inputs and outputs:

            ```scheme
            (chain (foo) :a (bar) @foo :b (baz))
            ```

            This will connect foo's "a" output to bar, then bar back into the same foo node, then foo's "b" output into
            baz.

            ### Blocking a connection

            The `@` backreference is useful to refer to the same node multiple times, but if there are nodes on both
            sides of the reference, Lynx will try to connect both an input and output, which may not be what you want.
            To suppress connections between two adjacent nodes, write `~` in between them:

            ```scheme
            (chain (foo) :a (bar) ~ @foo :b (baz))
            ```

            This will connect foo's "a" output to bar, and the "b" output into baz, but won't connect bar back into foo.

            ### Bussed ports

            Some nodes have *bussed* ports, meaning that they can output a variable number of values simultaneously in
            the form of an array. If you know the index in the array that you want to connect to, you can write the
            index next to the node:

            ```scheme
            (chain (foo-bus) 1 :xx :yy (bar))
            ```

            This will connect index 1 of foo-bus's :xx output into the :yy input of bar.

            If you try to connect a bussed port to a non-bussed port, without specifying a number, Lynx will yell at
            you. If both the input and output are buses, you must specify two numbers (to connect only one line) or no
            numbers (to connect all lines at once).
