            # Lynx!

            Lynx is a quick and easy flow-based programming tool that uses Scheme as a configuration language. Can'y say
            much about what it's been used for right now because it hasn't been... but I expect it will be
            eventually.

            * [Try it!](./editor)
            * [Read documentation](./docs)
            * [Browse examples](./examples)

            ## Features

            <!-- XXX: the code block must remain indented
             but HTML formatter wants to dedent it -->

            * **Compact syntax.** Creating a button that logs "Hello, World" when pressed is literally this simple:

                ```scheme
                (chain (button) :clicked (value :d "Hello, World!") ::0 (log))
                ```

            * **Built-in reference materials.** Not sure what a node does? Not sure what syntax to use? Check the
            [reference page](./docs/reference)
            * **Tons of examples.** Browse the [interactive examples page](./examples) or look at the files
            [directly](./examples/files).
            * **Linter to catch mistakes.** The [editor](./editor) will show red error messages for each node or
            connection that caused problems[^1].
            * **Shareable.** You can save the entire source of the flow to the URL, and then re-open and run it on
            another browser or device (provided the other computer supports everything required).
